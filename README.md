# DNS over TLS upstream server Docker container

*DNS over TLS upstream server connected to DNS over TLS (IPv4 and IPv6) servers with DNSSEC, DNS rebinding protection, built-in Docker healthcheck and fine grain IPs + hostnames blocking*

**Announcement**: *The image is being reworked to be a single binary with DoH and DoT without Unbound. The `:latest` Docker images might break compatibility soon.*

    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 53:53/udp qmcgaw/dns
    ```

    You can also use [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) with:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    More environment variables are described in the [environment variables](#environment-variables) section.

1. See the [Connect clients to it](#connect-clients-to-it) section, you can also refer to the [Verify DNS connection](#verify-dns-connection) section if you want.

## Environment variables

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PROVIDERS` | `cloudflare` | Comma separated list of DNS-over-TLS providers from `cloudflare`, `cloudflare.security`, `cloudflare.family`, `google`, `quad9`, `quadrant`, `cleanbrowsing`, `cleanbrowsing.family`, `cleanbrowsing.adult`, `libredns` and `cira` |
| `VERBOSITY` | `1` | From 0 (no log) to 5 (full debug log) |
| `VERBOSITY_DETAILS` | `0` | From 0 to 4 (higher means more details) |
| `BLOCK_MALICIOUS` | `on` | `on` or `off`, to block malicious IP addresses and malicious hostnames from being resolved |
| `BLOCK_SURVEILLANCE` | `off` | `on` or `off`, to block surveillance IP addresses and hostnames from being resolved |

## Extra configuration

You can bind mount an Unbound configuration file *include.conf* to be included in the Unbound server section with
`-v $(pwd)/include.conf:/unbound/include.conf:ro`, see [Unbound configuration documentation](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf/)

## Golang API

If you want to use the Go code I wrote, you can see tiny [examples](examples) of DoT and DoH resolvers and servers using the API developed.

## Connect clients to it

### Option 1: Router (recommended)

*All machines connected to your router will use the 1.1.1.1 encrypted DNS by default*

Configure your router to use the LAN IP address of your Docker host as its primary DNS address.

- Access your router page, usually at [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) and login with your credentials
- Change the DNS settings, which are usually located in *Connection settings / Advanced / DNS server*
- If a secondary fallback DNS address is required, use a dull ip address such as the router's IP 192.168.1.1 to force traffic to only go through this container

![](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/diagram-router.png?raw=true)

To ensure network clients cannot use another DNS, you might want to

- Block the outbound UDP 53 port on your router firewall
- Block the outbound TCP 853 port on your router firewall, **except from your Docker host**
- If you have *Deep packet inspection* on your router, block DNS over HTTPs on port TCP 443

### Option 2: Client, one by one

You have to configure each machine connected to your router to use the Docker host as their DNS server.

![](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/diagram-clients.png?raw=true)

#### Docker containers

Connect other Docker containers by specifying the DNS to be the host IP address `127.0.0.1`:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --dns=127.0.0.1 alpine
```

For *docker-compose.yml*:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  test:
    image: alpine:3.11
    network_mode: bridge
    dns:
      - 127.0.0.1
```

If the containers are in the same Docker network, you can simply set the `dns` to the LAN IP address of the DNS container (i.e. `10.0.0.5`)

#### Windows

1. Open the control panel and follow the instructions shown on the screenshots below.

![](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows1.png?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows2.png?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows3.png?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows4.png?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows5.png?raw=true)

Enter the IP Address of your Docker host as the **Preferred DNS server** (`192.168.1.210` in my case)
You can set the Cloudflare DNS server address 1.1.1.1 as an alternate DNS server although you might want to
leave this blank so that no domain name request is in plaintext.

![](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows6.png?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows7.png?raw=true)

When closing, Windows should try to identify any potential problems.
If everything is fine, you should see the following message:

![](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows8.png?raw=true)

#### Mac OS

Follow the instructions at [https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25577](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25577)

#### Linux

You probably know how to do that. Otherwise you can usually modify the first line of */etc/resolv.conf* by changing the IP address of your DNS server.

#### Android

See [this](http://xslab.com/2013/08/how-to-change-dns-settings-on-android/)

#### iOS

See [this](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/558)

### Firewall considerations

This container requires the following connections:

- UDP 53 Inbound (only if used externally)
- TCP 853 Outbound to 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1

### Verify DNS connection

1. Verify that you use Cloudflare DNS servers: [https://www.dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com) with the Standard or Extended test
1. Verify that DNS SEC is enabled: [https://en.internet.nl/connection](https://en.internet.nl/connection)

Note that [https://1.1.1.1/help](https://1.1.1.1/help) does not work as the container is not a client to Cloudflare servers but a forwarder intermediary. Hence https://1.1.1.1/help does not detect a direct connection to them.

## Go API

Some packages are exposed publicly through the [pkg](pkg) directory.

The API is at v1.x.x but (shame on me) is not stable and subject to change without changing major version. If you need it to be stable, please [create an issue](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/issues/new) and I'll see what I can do.

For now, it is used by the [gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun) project for its DNS over TLS usage.
